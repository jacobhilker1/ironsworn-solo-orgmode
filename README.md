# Ironsworn Solo template for org-mode
* This template was originally made by MisterMentat on the discord server. All credit for this goes to him, he gave me permission to upload it here. All credit for Ironsworn goes to Shawn Tomkin. Feel free to download the game [here](https://ironswornrpg.com/) for free. 

* To use this template, make a copy of the template, and open it up with emacs. Unfold the character section and start working on your character. Then, work on the world by unfolding the world section. Once that's done, feel free to start playing the game - I use the decide-mode plugin for rolling dice along with the oracles.
